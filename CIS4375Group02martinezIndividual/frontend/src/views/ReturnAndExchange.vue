        <h1>Return and Exchange Policy</h1>
        <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase from Trendi Finds. If for any reason you are not satisfied, we offer a hassle-free return and exchange policy.</p>
        <h2>1. Returns</h2>
        <p>You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. We'll also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.).</p>
        <h2>2. Exchanges</h2>
        <p>If you need to exchange an item for a different size or color, please return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.</p>
        <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
        <p>We will notify you once we've received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you'll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>
